Welcome to OMEGA documentation!
===================================

**OMEGA**, or open-source multi-dimensional tomographic reconstruction software, is an image reconstruction toolkit for tomographic imaging, optimized for positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) and computed tomography (CT). However, any ray-tracing based tomographic imaging is supported. The software works on MATLAB, `GNU Octave <https://octave.org/>`_ and Python. 
For a full list of features see :doc:`features`.

See :doc:`installation` for install help. Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
